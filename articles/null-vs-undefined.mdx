## NULL
### What is null?
> ### null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:

There are two features of null you should understand:
- `null` is an empty or non-existent value.
- `null` must be assigned.

In the example below, we are assigning value to null.
<CodeBlock>
```javascript
var x = null
console.log(x);
// null 
```
</CodeBlock>

- null expresses a lack of identification, indicating that variable points to no object
- When you assign null to a variable, you are declaring that this value is explicitly empty.

## UNDEFINED
### What is undefined?
> ### Undefined usually means a variable has been declared, but not defined.
- Another common scenario, where you will encounter an undefined is while trying to access a property of an object that doesn’t exist.

<CodeBlock>
```javascript
var z = {};
console.log(z.value);
// undefined
```
</CodeBlock>

- To summarize,
   - An object is declared but not defined/initialized.
   - Accessing an object property or an array index that does not exist.
   - Calling a function, without it’s required function parameters.

## What is similar?
- Both `null`and `undefined `are primitive values in JavaScript. 
- Another thing to note is that when comparing null and undefined they are equal. 
<CodeBlock>
```javascript
null == undefined
// true
```
</CodeBlock>

- This is because both of them are considered falsy values in JavaScript.

## Differences `null`vs. `undefined`
- ### Arithmetic Operations
> ### Another interesting difference to note is when arithmetic operations are performed with null vs. undefined.   
> ### Arithmetic operations with a null value will result in integer value while any arithmetic operation with undefined will result in the value of the variable being changed to `NaN`.

<CodeBlock>
```javascript
var x = 5 + null;
console.log(x);
// 5

var y = 5 + undefined;
console.log(y);
// NaN 
```
</CodeBlock>

- ## Equality
- ### Typeof Null and Undefined
- Interestingly enough, when using typeof to test null, it returns an object:
<CodeBlock>
```javascript
console.log(typeof(undefined));  //"undefined"
console.log(typeof(null));       //"object"
```
</CodeBlock>

- ### Comparison Using Abstract and Strict Equality
- Since these are different data types, if we compare them with strict equality ===, we get false.
- But if we compare them with abstract equality ==, we get true.

<CodeBlock>
```javascript
console.log(null === undefined)    //false
console.log(null == undefined)     //true
console.log(null !== undefined)    //true
```
</CodeBlock>

 ## Summary
- null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
- undefined typically means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
- null and undefined are falsy values.
- null and undefined are both primitives. However, an error shows that typeof null = object.
- `null` !== `undefined` but `null` == `undefined`.
